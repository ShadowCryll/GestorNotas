# Academic Grade Manager

University Project - The main objective of this project is to assemble a robust academic grade manager with multiple features designed to streamline data records and registration tasks. It is student-oriented, ensuring an easy and frictionless user experience. The system manages core operations to register, visualize, modify, delete, analyze, and organize course grades via a Python terminal interface, completely independent of external libraries.
   
It features an intuitive interactive console menu for seamless navigation. The system is built modularly and continues to grow over time. Development updates are published periodically, so stay tuned for exciting updates! :D

The software is programmed in Python as part of a modular university project roadmap. The design enforces "modularity" core concepts, separating execution logic into pure calculation functions and user-interaction procedures. Data is currently handled **in-memory** (non-persistent).

=======================================

## Project Development Milestones

### **Milestones 1 & 2 – Fundamentals & Modularity**
- Implemented grade registration for multiple students and academic courses.  
- Applied structural **modularity** by breaking code routines down into scoped functions and procedures[cite: 2].  
- Introduced formal code tracking via **preconditions** and **postconditions** in docstrings to document logical stability[cite: 2].  
- Integrated strict input validation constraining grade boundaries to the [0–100] range[cite: 2].

### **Milestone 3 – Conditionals, Counters & Search Fundamentals**
- Incorporated conditional branching structures and item counters to automatically flag **passed and failed** records[cite: 2].  
- Implemented **linear search** algorithms to locate specific entries by string name matching[cite: 2].  
- Enhanced console UI interaction loops via structured iterative menus[cite: 2].  

### **Milestone 4 – Record Deletion, Dynamic Lists & Separation of Concerns**
- Expanded CRUD controls by implementing single-item and structural **deletion options**[cite: 2].  
- Migrated code states to handle fully **dynamic lists**, eliminating obsolete static arrangements[cite: 2].  
- Documented and structurally isolated independent code blocks based on operational responsibilities[cite: 2].  
- Configured underlying system dependencies to welcome future abstract data structures[cite: 2].

### **Milestone 5 – Stacks, Queues & Algorithmic Sorting**
- Implemented a **Stack (LIFO)** data structure to track a live system log representing a user **action history**[cite: 2].  
- Created a **Queue (FIFO)** simulation engine managing standard **academic review requests** processed in exact order of submission[cite: 2].  
- Integrated two fundamental sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort**: Sorts records relative to numeric grades (descending order)[cite: 2].  
  - **Insertion Sort**: Sorts records alphabetically by target text fields[cite: 2].  
- Upgraded lookup routines with an optimized **Binary Search** implementation alongside traditional linear search mechanics[cite: 2].  
- Expanded the interface array into an all-inclusive multi-option layout coordinating system capabilities[cite: 2].

### **Milestone 6 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Re-architecture**
- Complete system overhaul migrating structural schemas to use `Course` and `GradeManager` classes[cite: 2].  
- Attributes and operations are cleanly encapsulated strictly inside `__init__` initializers without relying on boilerplate class variables or custom decorators[cite: 2].  
- Core data pipelines now leverage clean internal list models holding actual custom data object references[cite: 2].  
- Preserved existing interactive functionality while establishing a highly reusable, clean, and extensible software architecture[cite: 2].

====================================

## Program Architecture
The system layout separates concerns across distinct blocks[cite: 2]:

- **Pure Functions**  
  Dedicated computations isolated from side effects (e.g., `calculate_average()`)[cite: 2].

- **Interaction Procedures**  
  Handles user interface interaction steps, handling input validation, reading inputs, and handling print outputs[cite: 2].

- **Main Controller Engine**  
  Fires the initialization interface and controls step-by-step looping logic based on active user configurations[cite: 2].  

============================================
## Data Structures Applied

| Structure Type | Implementation Mechanics | Core System Responsibility |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Dynamic List** | Python standard `list` | Storing dynamic course collections and numeric grade matrices[cite: 2]. |
| **Stack (LIFO)** | Native `.append()` / `.pop()` | Tracking user changes, inserts, and operational state logs[cite: 2]. |
| **Queue (FIFO)** | Native `.append()` / `.pop(0)` | Sequential processing pipeline for academic grade review requests[cite: 2]. |

## Computer Science Algorithmic Implementations

| Algorithm | Method Category | Internal System Use Case |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort** | Sorting Logic | Reordering student indices by their grade averages in descending order[cite: 2]. |
| **Insertion Sort** | Sorting Logic | Reordering student data fields in ascending alphabetical progression[cite: 2]. |
| **Linear Search** | Sequential Search | Scanning unsorted collections for specific data fields[cite: 2]. |
| **Binary Search** | Optimized Search | Performing high-speed queries on pre-sorted alphabetized structures[cite: 2]. |

## Technical Project Execution Requirements

- Python runtime environment version **3.10** or greater[cite: 2].  
- Ideal development editors: **Visual Studio Code** or **PyCharm**[cite: 2].  
- Run routines independently out of standard system prompts without installing external libraries[cite: 2].  
- Fire up the system controller using standard execution lines:
```bash
  python grade_manager.py
